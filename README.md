### Hi there 👋

My name is **Alek** and I'm a **Computer Science** student at **University of Warsaw** in Poland 🇵🇱. Since primary school, programming has been my passion and hobby. In my free time, I like to focus on my private projects and learn new technologies. `Java` and other object-oriented languages are my favorite, but most of my current experience ranges from web programming in frameworks such as `Django`, `Angular` or `WordPress` to back-end libraries written in `C` or `C++`. During the first academic year functional programming language named `OCaml` attracted a lot of my attention.

### 👨‍💻 My experience ...
- During summer 2022 I was an **Software Engineer** intern at **Goldman Sachs** in Risk Division. 
  - Collecting Prometheus metrics, building Grafana dashboards, defining SLOs and alerts for Credit Risk Infrastructure.
  - Integrating existing services with **SRE** architecture.

- During the second year of my studies I was a part of [SIO2 project](https://github.com/sio2project/oioioi) which is a programming contest platform. I was responsible for developing new features and fixing bugs. My main focus was on the infrastructure of the project. My main accomplishments are:
  - I participated in architecture migration to `GitHub` from local `Gerrit` instance
  - I created `GitHub Action` automation workflows based on local `Hudson` instance
  - `Django` migration to latest LTS (*2.2.25* -> *3.2*)
  - I introduced **e2e** testing framework `Cypress`
  - Minor bug fixes
  - Check out [my contributions](https://github.com/sio2project/oioioi/commits?author=tudny)

- For three years I was a participant of [Summer IT Workshops](https://wwi.staszic.waw.pl/) organized by my High School. We were solving **programming problems** and learning new **algorithms** and **data structures**. All the problems were solved using `C/C++` code and `Bash` scripts. 

- In 2017 I started to interest in **Olympic programming**. I participated in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics for Junior High Schools and I was able to reach the **final round**. I also participated in Polish Olympiad in Informatics for High Schools, but I lost interest in this competition.

- In 2016 I was asked to **develop and maintain** my school's webpage. I was using `Wordpress` and `PHP` to meet the expectations. Although the page is deprecated you can still access it at https://gim.staszic.waw.pl/.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [**Kava org**](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/) - I'm a member of **Kava** org which is a group of students from University of Warsaw. We are working on a project which is a `Java framework` for web applications. We create common tools from scratch to learn advanced Java concepts as a part of the academic course. I work personally on **Server Container** [Arabica](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/Arabica) and **Logger** [Lungo](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/Lungo) module.
- [**Just Pure 2D Graphics Matrix Display**](https://github.com/mimuw-jnp2-rust/project-matrix-busters/) - Powerful matrix calculator with LaTeX support written in `Rust`.
- **Bachelor's Thesis Intern at JetBrains** - Support for `Rust` targets in Build Server for Bazel. Our goal is to integrate [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust) with [Bazel-BSP](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp) and IntelliJ IDEA.
