### Hi there 👋

My name is **Alek** and I'm a **Computer Science** student at **University of Warsaw** in Poland 🇵🇱 pursuing my Master's degree. Since primary school, programming has been my passion and hobby. In my spare time, I like to focus on my private projects and learn new technologies. I like to think about myself as a full-stack engineer. I have an experience in both creating frontend applications in `Django`, `Angular` or `WordPress`, but also writing libraries and programs in `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `Rust`, `Kotlin`, `Python`, `JS,` `TS`, `Assembly`, `OCaml`, `Haskell` or even `Prolog`. New challenges are my fuel, and I can't wait to solve new problems! 

My area of interest are **numerical methods**, including **numerical analysis** and **computer graphics**. My first numerical algorithms were created using `Matlab`/`Octave`, but currently I work mostly in `Python` (`numpy`/`scikit`) and `C` (for `OpenGL`). I intend to learn `Julia` in the near future.


### 👨‍💻 My experience ...
- Starting from summer 2023 I am a **Software Engineer** (Analyst) at **Goldman Sachs** in Risk Division.
  - Full stack engineer - `Java` / `React`
  - Worked with cluster computing and big data.

- During summer 2022 I was a **Software Engineer** intern at **Goldman Sachs** in Risk Division. 
  - Collecting Prometheus metrics, building Grafana dashboards, defining SLOs and alerts for Credit Risk Infrastructure.
  - Integrating existing services with **SRE** architecture.

- During the second year of my studies I was a part of [SIO2 project](https://github.com/sio2project/oioioi) which is a programming contest platform. I was responsible for developing new features and fixing bugs. My main focus was on the infrastructure of the project. My main accomplishments are:
  - I participated in architecture migration to `GitHub` from local `Gerrit` instance
  - I created `GitHub Action` automation workflows based on local `Hudson` instance
  - `Django` migration to latest LTS (*2.2.25* -> *3.2*)
  - I introduced **e2e** testing framework `Cypress`
  - Minor bug fixes
  - Check out [my contributions](https://github.com/sio2project/oioioi/commits?author=tudny)

- For three years I was a participant of [Summer IT Workshops](https://wwi.staszic.waw.pl/) organized by my High School. We were solving **programming problems** and learning new **algorithms** and **data structures**. All the problems were solved using `C/C++` code and `Bash` scripts. 

- In 2017 I started to interest in **Olympic programming**. I participated in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics for Junior High Schools and I was able to reach the **final round**. I also participated in Polish Olympiad in Informatics for High Schools, but I lost interest in this competition.

- In 2016 I was asked to **develop and maintain** my school's webpage. I was using `Wordpress` and `PHP` to meet the expectations. ~~Although the page is deprecated you can still access it at https://gim.staszic.waw.pl/.~~

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- [**Master's thesis**](https://apd.uw.edu.pl/diplomas/236202/) - Lindenmayer systems, Computer Graphics and Parallel Computing. TBA...

### 🔭 A few interesting projects ...
- [**Kava org**](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/) - I'm a member of **Kava** org which is a group of students from University of Warsaw. We are working on a project which is a `Java framework` for web applications. We create common tools from scratch to learn advanced Java concepts as a part of the academic course. I work personally on **Servlet Container** [Arabica](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/Arabica) and **Logger** [Lungo](https://github.com/jaks-mimuw-kava-org/Lungo) module.
- [**Just Pure 2D Graphics Matrix Display**](https://github.com/mimuw-jnp2-rust/project-matrix-busters/) - Powerful matrix calculator with LaTeX support written in `Rust`.
- [**Bachelor's Thesis Intern at JetBrains**](https://github.com/zpp-This-is-fine/) - Support for `Rust` targets in Build Server for Bazel. Our goal is to integrate [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust) with [Bazel-BSP](https://github.com/JetBrains/bazel-bsp) and IntelliJ IDEA.
- [**Jabba the Lang**](https://github.com/tudny/JPP-interpreter) - Interpreted imperative programming language written in `Haskell`.
- [**Latte**](https://github.com/tudny/MRJP-Latte) - A `llvm`-based compiler for a simple imperative programming language written in `Haskell`.

<!--
### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- **Bazel** - As a part of my Bachelor's Thesis.

A few courses from my University:
- **Haskell** - Required to create interpreter of my own programming language. TBA soon... 🤫
- **Bioinformatics** - One of my non-obligatory lectures at my University.
-->

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- [**Computer graphics**](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/%7Eprzemek/notatki.html) - I'm learning how to create 3D scenes using `OpenGL` and `GLSL` as a part of my Master's program.
- [**Lindenmayer systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) - I'm learning how to create fractals using `L-systems` by leveraging `OpenGL` and `GLSL` as a part of my Master's Thesis.
- [**HPC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) - I'm taking part in HPC class during my Master's studies. Working both with `CUDA` (shared memory model) and `MPI` (latency-bandwidth model).
- [**Big Data**](https://i.imgflip.com/nt8op.jpg) - I'm taking part in Big Data class during my Master's studies. It involves `Spark`, `HDFS` and lot's of theory.
